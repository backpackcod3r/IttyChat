Specification
=============

This is a proof-of-concept simple chat server that accepts Telnet
connections and drops all connected users into a single "chat
room". Think IRC, but much, much less useful.

Running the Server
==================

Just run with node.js as follows:

  % node ittychat.js 3000

This will start the server listening on port 3000.

If you want to limit the server to listening only on localhost, use
the "-l" argument:

  % node ittychat.js -l 3000

This is useful for debugging.


Using the Chat
==============

While a client such as TinyFugue can be used, plain ol' telnet works
fine. Just telnet to the chat server's address and port, and you're connected.


Commands begin with a period.

.who

  Print a list of all the userse in the chat.

.connect <username>

  Join the chat with the given username.

.quit

  Leave the chat and disconnect.

.me <msg>

  Pose command. Displays your username followed by the message.  For
  example, if your name is "JimBob":

    '.me slaps himself with a fish'

  Will display

    '* JimBob slaps himself with a fish'

  to all the users in the chat.

.say <msg>

  Speak the given message to the room. For example, if your name is
  "JimBob":

    '.say Hello!'

  Will display

    '[JimBob]: Hello!'

  to all the users in the chat.

  Additionally, any input that is NOT prefixed with a slash will be assumed
  to be the '.say' command.

.nick <newname>

  Will change your nickname from your current name to the new name.


TODO
====

* Deal with idle sockets.

* Deal with chunked input.

* Allow a 'max_clients' variable to be set.

* SSL connections.

* Authentication
  - Shared password for connections?
    - Would require a single variable to set the secret.
  - Per-user password hash for connections?
    - Would require a simple file store for user / crypted pass

* Multiple chat rooms


Design Philosophy
=================

My goal with this project, first and foremost, was learning Node.js.
This is my first attempt at a project in Node.js, so I wanted to do
something that I found genuinely interesting but simple enough to
bite off in an evening or weekend. Chat servers are well known
problems, there's nothing new here, but they are complex enough to
have fun with!
